BACKGROUND COLOR BUTTON:
This is the first project and it's under Index.html

Always remember to make a link to the tutorial you use.
I set this up in LESS for practice.
We took the colors off of an array.

Remember when you are doing a querySelector, you need to include the dot in front of the class name! That had me stuck for 10 minutes.

'Body' is an html element so it doesn't get the dot in front. It's not a class.

HEX COLOR BUTTON:
I did this with normal CSS instead of LESS
Looks fun- this time we took the colors off of a Array? 
An array of randomly selected list of hex capable list. That way the colors are random. So the Array goes from 0 - F and it takes a random selection from the array for each run of a 6 step loop to fill the hexadecimal numbers to be used for color control (or out of controol).

FAMOUS PEOPLE QUOTE GENERATOR:
This is another application of the random number generator used to select an object from an array. The array is full of famous quotes and names of the people that made them. We use the math floor to wrap around the math random multiplied by the length of the array and publish the values in that selected object with dot notation.

COUNTER: 
Make a couple of buttons that will raise or lower a value of a published variable. In this case a number. We put in some small changes as well like making the counted number change color per the value and some animated.
I need to start the counter at 1:13:18 at the time hack.

BACKGROUND IMAGE CHANGER:
I imagine this will be set on the same control basis as the counter. Same buttons, same counter, just using the counter as the variable in a file list where the files all end with a number. That way, when the style is replaced, you can call the background image with string interpolation.
